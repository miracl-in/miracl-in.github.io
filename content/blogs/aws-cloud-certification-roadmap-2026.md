## Core AWS Services Every Professional Should Master

### Compute Services

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud providing scalable computing capacity. EC2 forms the backbone of most AWS deployments, offering various instance types optimized for different workloads.

**AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service enabling code execution without server management. Lambda supports event-driven architectures and microservices, automatically scaling based on demand.

**Amazon ECS/EKS**: Container orchestration services for Docker containers. ECS provides AWS-native container management, while EKS offers managed Kubernetes clusters.

### Storage Services

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. S3 supports various storage classes for different access patterns and cost optimization.

**Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: High-performance block storage for EC2 instances, providing persistent storage that persists independently of instance lifecycle.

**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**: Fully managed NFS file system for EC2 instances, providing shared storage across multiple instances.

### Database Services

**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational database service supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. RDS handles routine database tasks like provisioning, patching, backup, and scaling.

**Amazon DynamoDB**: Fully managed NoSQL database service providing fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB supports both document and key-value data models.

**Amazon Redshift**: Fully managed data warehouse service enabling fast query performance using columnar storage and parallel query execution.

### Networking Services

**Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated cloud resources within AWS, providing complete control over virtual networking environment including IP address ranges, subnets, and routing tables.

**Amazon CloudFront**: Global content delivery network (CDN) service accelerating delivery of websites, APIs, video content, and other web assets to users worldwide.

**AWS Direct Connect**: Dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS, providing more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

## AWS Security and Compliance

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM enables secure access control to AWS services and resources. Key concepts include:
- **Users**: Individual identities with unique credentials
- **Groups**: Collections of users with similar permissions
- **Roles**: Temporary credentials for applications and services
- **Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions

### Security Best Practices

**Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum permissions necessary for users and applications to perform their functions.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add extra security layer requiring additional verification beyond passwords.

**Encryption**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Config for comprehensive monitoring and compliance tracking.

## AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

### Understanding AWS Pricing Models

**On-Demand Pricing**: Pay for compute capacity by hour or second with no long-term commitments.

**Reserved Instances**: Significant discounts (up to 75%) in exchange for one or three-year commitments.

**Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at potentially substantial discounts (up to 90%).

### Cost Management Tools

**AWS Cost Explorer**: Visualize and analyze AWS spending patterns with detailed cost and usage reports.

**AWS Budgets**: Set custom cost and usage budgets with alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

**AWS Trusted Advisor**: Provides recommendations for cost optimization, security, performance, and fault tolerance.
